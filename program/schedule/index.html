                             explore two easy ways to create web maps using Python: Streamlit and PyScript. We&#39;ll build a web app that helps you find the perfect hiking trail in Washington state, and in the process, learn how to integrate geographic data, visualize it interactively, and deploy it to the web.

Each tool offers a unique approach to building interactive maps. With Streamlit, you’ll see how simple it is to set up a dashboard (that includes maps) with minimal code. Then, we’ll dive into PyScript, which enables you to run Python directly in the browser, allowing you to create and deploy a web map without having Python installed.

By the end of this talk, you&#39;ll understand two straightforward methods to create and deploy web maps with Python, with practical examples you can begin using right away!

                             share Python code is by packaging it, any other way hurts your consumers. Packaging can be an intimidating topic most would rather avoid but following just a few best practices of packaging can make your code much easier to share, even without going through the process of uploading to pypi.org.

                             Even though the default interpreter still uses the GIL, it has provisions that allow us to run a free-threaded version of the interpreter with the GIL disabled. 

In this talk, we’ll set up and run the free-threaded interpreter and benchmark it with the GIL-enabled version for various kinds of tasks. We&#39;ll assess the impact on single-threaded vs multithreaded code and test the performance across CPU-bound and I/O-bound tasks, aiming to identify scenarios where free-threaded Python excels.

In this talk you’ll see a comprehensive approach to data quality, implementing checks at various parts of the data lifecycle. You&#39;ll also learn a bit about wildfire preparedness along the way. If you’ve experienced the chaotic nature of real-world data and are looking for a way to quench the flames this session is for you.

                             frustrating, right? As users, we feel the inconvenience immediately. To prevent these disruptions, engineering teams rely on various tools and practices to address unexpected system behavior. In today’s distributed world, applications are often segmented into microservices to improve agility and performance. This also brings added complexity, with more opportunities for things to go wrong - errors, latency and more. In this dynamic landscape, observability has evolved from a mere buzzword into a crucial approach for modern reliable systems. We initially gravitate towards a tool for its ease of use, but later after investing significant amount of time and finances, if we choose to migrate, vendor lock-in becomes a major concern. This is where the importance of open standards like OpenTelemetry become essential.

While many think of observability as solely an issue for SREs, but it’s increasingly a developer concern. During this session, we’ll explore why observability matters and how it is evolved over the years. We&#39;ll cover how to instrument Python code, process telemetry data and export it seamlessly for analysis. Attendees will leave with a clearer understanding of how observability increases confidence in managing complex systems and how adopting open standards improve the overall developer experience. Let’s work together to redefine OSS observability, as a shared responsibility through collaboration.

                             talk will explore Reproducible Builds by highlighting issues
identified in Python projects, from the simple to the seemingly
inscrutible.

Reproducible Builds is basically the crazy idea that when you build
something, and you build it again, you get the exact same thing... or
even more important, if someone else builds it, they get the exact
same thing too.

Through a few code examples demonstrating common problems folks will
learn what to watch out for when coding and how to fix them once
identified.

Some of the useful tooling for diagnosing and troubleshooting
reproducibility issues (diffoscope and reprotest)... just so happen to
be written in Python! Will even show you how to use them... and maybe
take a look inside.

                             packages or projects inside one repository. In most cases, it is better to just have multiple repositories that each contain a library, an application or a data science project with Jupyter notebooks. However, in some cases it makes sense to have a monorepo containing multiple projects often sharing a common theme or an ecosystem. This talk will explore the circumstances where monorepos make more sense, how to create monorepos containing Python libraries and projects, handle dependencies, version management and CI/CD setup. We shall go through a sample Python mono repository, thus making it practical for attendees to follow along.

                             alerts in tech environments, a practice that stems from alert overload and leads to critical oversights. I dissect the roots, including alert fatigue and a culture that undervalues preventative measures, and highlight symptoms like excessive reliance on email filtering. My talk proposes actionable solutions to ensure alerts are meaningful and directed at the right people, advocating for a shift towards a culture where alerts enhance organizational efficiency and resilience. Join me as I offer insights into transforming error management from a neglected aspect into a cornerstone of proactive organizational strategy.

                             &#34;cron on steroids&#34;. For a career data engineer, this tool has been central in my success at orchestrating and maintaining data pipelines. But Airflow&#39;s applications have grown far beyond the intent for which it was originally built. What was once a machine learning training engine is now a tool I&#39;ve used extensively over the last 8 years. I&#39;ve used it across 4 jobs, in several different roles; for side projects and critical infrastructure; for manually triggered jobs and automated workflows; for IT (Ookla/Speedtest.net), science (Allen Institute for Cell Science), the commons (Openverse), the future (Babylist), and liberation (Orca Collective). In this talk, I&#39;ll be sharing a brief overview of what Apache Airflow is and how it might be able to help manage *your* workflows too! As an Airflow user and contributor for the last 8 years, I&#39;ve seen how this tool can quickly become the hammer for every nail you see. Part of what makes Airflow powerful is that you can define its workflows in pure Python; this means you can leverage all of the clever language features and libraries Python has to offer when setting up a job. No more pesky and repetitive YAML files (GitHub Actions) or domain-specific languages (Jenkins). Use the language and libraries you&#39;re familiar with while getting automatic retries, error handling, control flow, and so much more.

We&#39;ll compare traditional WSGI-based frameworks with the ASGI ecosystem and explore how async I/O enhances concurrency for managing multiple I/O-bound tasks. Attendees will gain practical insights into building ASGI-compliant apps with FastAPI, learn key concurrency patterns, and discover best practices for integrating asynchronous operations with external APIs. Whether you&#39;re building APIs, managing websockets, or running background tasks, this session will equip you to write fast, efficient, and scalable Python applications.

Drawing from my experiences in tech communities, especially those focused on gender inclusion, we’ll discuss strategies for amplifying voices, fostering meaningful engagement, and driving tangible outcomes. Attendees will gain insights on leveraging their tech communities to enhance visibility and learn actionable steps to ensure their efforts go beyond internal circles, reaching a broader audience and creating lasting impact.

We&#39;ll cover microprocessors as the &#34;brain&#34; of your robot, LEDs for visual feedback, actuators for adding movement, and sensors for touch and light.
Whether you&#39;re a complete beginner or have dabbled in electronics before, this talk will equip you with the knowledge to start building your own robotic projects.
