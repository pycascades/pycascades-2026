#### First Login

When you login for the first time, you'll be prompted to complete your user profile. It'll first ask you to fill in your **display name** and a **profile photo** (or use Gravatar/LinkedIn to connect your information). Adding a photo or avatar will make it easier for people to recognize you throughout the event.

These are the first screens you'll encounter when logging in. **You can change all of these later on your profile page.**

#### Additional Profile Questions

We have added a few **optional profile questions**. They'll help you to share some more details about you with the rest of the attendees:

*   **Pronouns**: we ask that you add your pronouns to make sure everyone feels welcome and comfortable sharing theirs as well. This'll make it easier to interact with people in a **respectful way** and allows others to address you **the way you prefer to be addressed**.
*   **Open To DMs**: you can indicate that you are open to other attendees DM'ing you. Alternatively, you can let others know you'd prefer not to be contacted. **This is a guide for others and not enforced through the platform.**
*   **Company/School/Institution**: Feel free to share who you work for or are affiliated with.
*   **Social Media**: Share you twitter/Bluesky/LinkedIn URL.
*   **Mastodon**: Alternatively or in addition, share your Mastodon user URL.
