PyCascades is a volunteer-run conference. Without our wonderful community (including folks like you!) we would not be able to make PyCascades a delightful experience.

If you're interested in volunteering, thank you! Check out the descriptions below and fill out the in-person volunteer sign up sheet. We'll link to it here once it's available.

### In-Person Roles

The conference will be held at SFU Harbour Centre in Vancouver, BC, Canada. Everyone will be assigned one shift, so you still have a chance to enjoy the conference. We unfortunately aren't able to offer all volunteers a free ticket. Please purchase your ticket before the event. If the ticket price is burdensome, please apply for a grant.

*   **Venue Setup & Teardown**: Help with setting up the conference space in the morning and cleaning up the conference space in the evening. Expect about an hour of time before and/or after the talks on conference days.
*   **Check-in & Info Desk**: Responsible for checking tickets and distributing badges, swag and lanyards to attendees. Expect one morning or afternoon of the conference days, or the first half of the pre-social (if we hold one).
*   **Green Room**: Responsible for tending to the green room, making sure it stays a quiet space for speakers to prepare for their talks, and assisting with any issues speakers have. Tech support will be handled by our A/V person. Expect one morning or afternoon of the conference days.
*   **Session Chair**: Responsible for introducing speakers, ensuring speakers stay on time, and handling speaker change-over. Session chairs must be comfortable speaking in front of large crowds, no prior experience required. Expect one morning or afternoon of the conference days.
*   **Quiet Room**: Responsible for tending the quiet room, keeping it quiet and welcoming. Expect one morning or afternoon of the conference days.
