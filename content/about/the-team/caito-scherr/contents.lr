bio: Caito is a Developer Advocate in Portland, OR. Working with this event is the perfect ven diagram for them of inclusive community building, programming, and the irresistible, inspirational Python flavored makerspace that PyCascades attracts. In their "free time", they do dance and duo trapeze, trail running, and never-ending construction/remodeling projects, sometimes with a dash of sculpture, prop-building and woodworking. They also love Python so much, they have three of them 🐍
