PyCascades is a regional PyCon in the Pacific Northwest, celebrating the west coast Python developer and user community. Our organizing team includes members of the Vancouver, Seattle, and Portland Python user groups.

Started in 2018, PyCascades has previously been a two-day, single-track Python conference. We are excited to be returning to Vancouver for 2026.
