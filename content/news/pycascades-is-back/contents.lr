# Why PyCascades Rocks!

- Awesome Pythonistas - meet in a cozy, laid-back setting. Friendly faces not faceless hordes!
- Sweet stickers - because what’s a conference without laptop swag?
- Open-source partners - swap ideas, contribute, or (like me!) accidentally join their team
- Accessible speakers - no giant crowds. Ask questions, grab coffee, or geek out over that new Python feature; you know the one. (Or just say hi!)
- Wonderful sponsors - Chat one-on-one about jobs, their best-kept software secrets, or what a DevRel actually does

# Speaking of Wonderful Sponsors…

Your company could be one of those Wonderful Sponsors! At PyCascades, sponsors get something rare in today’s conference world: time, space, and quiet to actually talk with our engaged Python community. No shouting over expo hall noise, no distracted half-conversations, just real conversations with potential co-workers, users, or collaborators. Diamond Sponsors get exclusive perks:

- Everlasting visibility - Your logo on all recorded talks (forever on YouTube)
- A chance to speak - 5 minutes during closing remarks
- Top billing - Your logo and a brief message in conference communications

💎 Only 2 available, get ‘em while they last! 💎

##“But how will we know it worked?”

We’re happy to brainstorm meaningful success metrics - whether it’s quality hires, in-depth product feedback, or just being remembered as that cool company that actually listened.
