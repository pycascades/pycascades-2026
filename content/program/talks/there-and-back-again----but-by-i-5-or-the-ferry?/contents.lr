title: There and back again... but by I-5 or the ferry?

description:

Living on Washington State’s peninsula offers endless beauty, nature, and commuting challenges. In this talk, I’ll share how I built an agentic AI system that creates and compares optimal routes to the mainland, factoring in ferry schedules, costs, driving distances, and live traffic. Originally a testbed for the Model Context Protocol (MCP) framework, this project now manages my travel schedule, generates expense estimates, and sends timely notifications for events. I’ll give a comprehensive overview of MCP, show how to quickly turn ideas into working agentic AI, and discuss practical integration with real-world APIs. Attendees will leave with MCP Server resources and tutorials and a roadmap for building their own agentic AI solutions. A comfortable grasp of Python functions, API calls, framework decorators, and the role of context with LLMs is recommended.
