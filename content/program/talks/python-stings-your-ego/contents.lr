title: Python Stings Your Ego: Finding Pride in Community, Not Just Code
---
description:

In tech, it’s easy to get caught up in ego. Chasing the smartest solutions, writing the most complex code, or proving who’s the best in the room. But Python has a funny way of humbling us. Its simplicity reminds us that good code isn’t about showing off; it’s about making things clear, accessible, and collaborative.

This talk is about what happens after that sting of humility. Python doesn’t just strip away ego, it builds communities that make you feel proud to belong. I’ll share stories from my journey with Black Python Devs and other Python groups, showing how people from all walks of life come together, support one another, and create space for growth.

By the end, you’ll see that the real magic of Python isn’t just the language. It’s the people, the openness, and the sense of pride that comes from being part of something bigger than yourself.
